# ðŸ‘‹ Welcomes

Welcomes are simply events that send a message upon member join/leave.

### Here are the steps to enable welcome messages in your server.

Use /logging welcomes. Put the channel as the channel you want to set (or leave blank if you want to delete welcomes). You can set custom messages or use the default.

You should see a message in the channel. If you can't get it, refer to [.](./ "mention").
