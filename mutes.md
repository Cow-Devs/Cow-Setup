# ü§ê Mutes

Mutes are the slightest bit complicated. They use a role that you can set or have the bot automatically create with the proper permissions. These are the two options:

#### 1. Set a muted role

This is a simple process of you using /moderation setmutedrole then selecting a role. The role id will be stored within the bot's files and is used when attempting to mute a member. This stored role will also be used for unmutes.

#### 2. Let the bot make one

If you attempt to mute a member without a muted role set, the bot will make one for you. It will also set your muted role as this role. This will not happen with unmutes.

The bot will log any mutes and unmutes to your modlog channel if you one set.
